Passport-twitter Strategy Explanation:

The passport-twitter strategy allows your app to authenticate a 
user with their existing twitter account.

To utilize this strategy you must first register your app with 
twitter.com.  When registering, you must provide a callback URL that
matches the route on your app that will bring users to twitter to 
login.  After registering your app, you will be issued an API key 
and an API secret.  The API key, API secret and the callbak URL must
be included as properties of the new strategy of your app.

Now, when a user clicks on the sign-up button for your app, they will be directed to 
the callback URL.  This route will direct the user to twitter.com.  The user will 
then login to twitter.  After the user has logged in, Twitter sends an access token 
to your app specifically for the user. Your app will then send the access token back 
to twitter and when twitter verifies the access token, it will send back the 
protected resources regarding the user, and the user is now authenticated.
